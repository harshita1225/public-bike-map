## Public Bikes

You are task with creating a desktop React application, which shows all local bike rental providers globally on a world map. (see Image below)

## Link

- Live Site URL: [https://harshita1225.github.io/public-bike-map/](https://harshita1225.github.io/public-bike-map/)

### Task

- Your page should have an input field
- Your page should display a `Map` with `Markers` for each bike rental provider
- Your map should contain a `ZoomControl`.
- Your page should list all bike rental providers below the `Map`.
- While the user tips, your app should update your markers on the map and the bike rental provider list.
- When the user clicks on a `Marker`, additional information about the provider should be displayed.

### Points to consider

- You will use the [CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) to get all bike rental providers.
- Use `useEffect` to control and change your states every time a user makes a search request.
- You can use [Pigeon Maps](https://pigeon-maps.js.org/docs/) in order to display your map with all your fetched providers
- Research on `Map, Marker, ZoomControl, Overlay`

## additional

- Use javascript's [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to center your map around your current location as default.
